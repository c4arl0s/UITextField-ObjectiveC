### The UIWindow has a pointer called firstResponder which indicates who should respond to the other type of events.

- when you select a textField, the window moves its firstResponder pointer to that text field.
- Motion and remote controls events are sent to the first responder.
- Most views refuse to become first responder; they do not want to steal focus from the currently selected text field or text view.
